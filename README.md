# Hypothesis Testing
### In this project we'll check whether the hypothesis 'University towns in United States have their mean housing prices less effected by recessions.' is true or not.

To test the hypothesis we'll use the following data files:
* From the [Zillow research data site](http://www.zillow.com/research/data/) there is housing data for the United States. In particular the datafile for [all homes at a city level](http://files.zillowstatic.com/research/public/City/City_Zhvi_AllHomes.csv), ```City_Zhvi_AllHomes.csv```, has median home sale prices at a fine grained level.
* From the Wikipedia page on college towns is a list of [university towns in the United States](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_college_towns#College_towns_in_the_United_States) which has been copy and pasted into the file ```university_towns.txt```.
* From Bureau of Economic Analysis, US Department of Commerce, the [GDP over time](http://www.bea.gov/national/index.htm#gdp) of the United States in current dollars (use the chained value in 2009 dollars), in quarterly intervals, in the file ```gdplev.xls```.
##### For this project, we'll only look at GDP data from the first quarter of 2000 onward.

These are the terms we'll be using across the project:
* A _quarter_ is a specific three month period, Q1 is January through March, Q2 is April through June, Q3 is July through September, Q4 is October through December.
* A _recession_ is defined as starting with two consecutive quarters of GDP decline, and ending with two consecutive quarters of GDP growth.
* A _recession bottom_ is the quarter within a recession which had the lowest GDP.
* A _university town_ is a city which has a high percentage of university students compared to the total population of the city.
